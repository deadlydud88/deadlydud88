- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
-   Creating a specific structure of acquiring user stories will help develop and interpret user needs. This will include a way of gathering requirements for each user based on their role and why they need functionality. 
- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
-   The first step to developing programs is to evalaute the roles and responsibilities of team members. Having a cross functional team helps to get work done quickly when there is an authentic, safe environment. 
- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
-   Being accountable for your work is essential, including the ability to self identify blockers and vulnerable enough to bring issues to other people for help. Another important aspect of being a good team member is to not place blame on any mistakes, and to work cohesively so all code is every development team member's responsibility.
